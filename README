Populate a DataONE (http://dataone.org) Generic Member Node with public
metadata from a GeoNetwork (http://geonetwork-opensource.org/) instance.

The International Arctic Research Center (IARC) Data Archive uses the xml
form of ISO 19115 metadata, ISO 19139. Not all researchers fill out
metadata that validates, however, so this code xslt transforms the public
ISO 19139 metadata records from IARC's geonetwork OAI-PMH endpoint into
dublin core extended (dcx), and inserts the corresponding geonetwork page 
under the 'source' element. It then uploads the validated dcx into IARC's 
DataONE GMN as metadata, while the original ISO 19139 metadata is uploaded 
as data (text/xml). A resource map relating the two completes the package.
Each time this script runs, it checks to see if a package update is required:
the current GMN ISO 19139 data object (xml) is compared with the downloaded
OAI-PMH version, and if different, triggers the package update.

Code development is ongoing, with the desired goal of uploading all data in 
addition to metadata.
